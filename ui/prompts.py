Should we move to the next topic? Consider carefully and be conservative in your decision.
The discussion should thoroughly explore the current topic before moving on.

Specific requirements to move on:
1. Have ALL key questions been addressed in detail?
2. Has the discussion explored multiple perspectives and implications?
3. Have we covered both high-level strategy and specific implementation details?
4. Has there been a natural conclusion to the current discussion thread?
5. Have we discussed concrete examples and applications?

Only respond 'yes' if requirements reasonably are met. Otherwise respond 'no'.
